I created a webpage for my 3D rendering final project. The webpage includes a canvas element
with an id of "myWebGLCanvas" that displays the 3D object I rendered. I added the ability to
shade the object with either Gouraud or Phong shading, or display it in wireframe mode. To
allow the user to choose the shading mode and shape of the object, I added two drop-down
menus.
To handle the rendering and updating of the 3D object, I used several JavaScript files, including
"renderer.js," "shapes.js," "MV.js," and "webgl-utils.js." These files allowed me to manage the
rendering process and update the object on the canvas in real-time.
In addition to the shading options, I added input boxes for the vertex and fragment shaders. The
user can enter their own code into these boxes, which allows for customization of the shading
and rendering process. To manage user interface elements like color pickers and file input
types, I utilized jQuery and jQuery UI
